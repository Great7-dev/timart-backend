After cloning the repo run "yarn"
NB: make sure your MySQL server is running either with MySQL bench or Xampp before starting the app
After running "yarn" then run "yarn start"
The app is suppose to start running but am still having bug trying to fix the tables to create automatically
But if you comment out the function to create the tables and create it manually using MySQL bench it will work perfectly fine.
